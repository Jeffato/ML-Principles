20 points for each of the problems
So total 100 + 20 (extra credit problem) = 120

1.  
1.1 (7 p)
- if the example gives 100% precision
1.2 (7 p)
- if the example gives 100% recall
1.3 (6 p)
- this can have various answers
- balance between true positive and false negative ex) F1, accuracy, etc.
2. 
2.1 and 2.2 (3 p)
2.3 and 2.4 (4 p)
2.5 (6 p)
- (3 p) PMF 
- (3 p) binomial R.V is sum of bernoulli R.V for Central Limit Theorem
3.
3.1 and 3.3 (8 p)
3.2 (4 p): I realized that 3.2 answers are already shown in the problem description; even if a detailed derivation is not shown, it is okay.
4. 
4.1 and 4.2 (4 p)
4.3 and 4.4 (3 p)
4.5 and 4.6 (3 p)
- for 4.5 and 4.6, there can be various answers. For 4.5 standardization would not make a difference in terms of the algorithm, but some points will be possible if there is reasonable analysis. 
5. 
5.1 and 5.2 (10 p)
- for 5.2, I guided students to compute numerical matrices A and b after computing eigenvalues and vectors by using numpy (if there is no numerical outcomes then -5)
- for 5.2, there can be various ways. you could check the answers by using A[COV(x)]A^{t}  = I and AE[X] + b = 0
 
6. Extra: 20p
6.1 (4 p)
6.2 (8 p) 
- variance (4 p)
- mean (4 p)
6.3 (8 p)
- N goes to inf (3 p)
- N goes to zero (3 p)
- prior effect becomes negligible N goes to large (2p)
